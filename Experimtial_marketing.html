                    <p>Experiential marketing and event experience are extremely important for all forms of corporate
                        communications in recent years. Over the last two decades, marketing has evolved from a
                        broadcast mentality, pushing a message outward to everyone, to a narrowcast reality, engaging
                        individuals in ways that are meaningful to them. Marketing is not just a two-way conversation,
                        but brand messages sent out must radiate and amplified by influencers and opinion makers.</p>
                    <p>In today’s new media landscape, communicating to consumers with a fleeting attention span and
                        dislike for advertising can be a challenge. Experiential marketing offers this new avenue to
                        connect with consumers. It is important to have well-designed and successful executed
                        experiential marketing events so that they could bolster lasting connections between customers
                        and brands. In conclusion, experiential marketing has become an integral part of many brands’
                        overall marketing and event strategy today.</p>
