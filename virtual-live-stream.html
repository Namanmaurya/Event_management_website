                            <p>As we pivot from live events to virtual events, demand for broadcast and live stream studios have increase tremendously. Virtual events can have many moving parts with both ‘TV-produced quality’ and ‘reality TV-like’ components.</p>
                            <p>As a virtual event company in India , we have specially created a customized space where all virtual shows come to reality. Hence this space can be used to host different forms of virtual events including Live Streaming Programs, Talk Shows, Webinars, and Online Conferences. Our studios are also equipped with quality audio systems, professional lighting as well as broadcast quality video cameras.</p>
                            <p>In addition, our team of sound engineers, cameramen, show producers, lighting designers, video editors, visual artists and graphic designers are the standard-bearer for creativity and innovation in broadcasting. In short, we are qualified to fulfill our clients’ cinematic visions.</p>

                            <h3 class="my-2">Green Screen Studios</h3>

                            <p>Our studios have customized green screen backdrops and VFX artists to make virtual 3D background come to life on screen. Why is green screen technology so amazing? Firstly, green screen is a visual effects (VFX) technique using chroma key compositing, where two images or animated video streams are layered together. Secondly, green screen allows you drop in separate background images you want behind the show host/presenter/speaker. Lastly, it is commonly used in movie/TV production, news broadcast and on-screen weather reports. As noticed, you will usually see green screen backdrops used on Hollywood movies’ sets when watching behind-the-scenes clips or bloopers reels. Importantly, our green screen VFX designs are used by many clients as an integral part of their virtual online streaming events.</p>
                            <h3 class="my-2">LED Video Wall Virtual Production Studios</h3>
                            <p>Our studios also specialized in using LED video walls for creating an immersive on-screen experience for your virtual event. First of all, LED walls are revolutionizing production process by projecting 3D environments in real time as a backdrop to provide the illusion of being in a physical location. Next, these revolutionary methods were put to the test on Disney’s “The Mandalorian,” and well as upcoming HBO Max’s “Titans, Season 3”. In conclusion, this process of combining traditional cinematography techniques with advanced world-building technology effectively overtake the need for a green screen.</p>
                            <h3 class="my-2">Cyclorama Studio & 3D Live Virtual Set</h3>
                            <p>‘Cyc’ an abbreviated term for cyclorama, often referred to as a cyclorama wall or cyc wall. A cyclorama as “a curved wall is used as a background of a stage set to suggest unlimited space”. Cyc studio is the latest trend of livestream studio to be used in India  for virtual events production. Cyclorama studios are used with massive 3D virtual sets. Audiences can see the speakers on screen in 360° 3D virtual background. The production will be enhanced with cinematic camera shots and special effects animation. Professional cyc studio backgrounds have been used as the green screen backgrounds for many Hollywood movies such as “Batman vs. Superman” and “The Hunger Games”.

                            <p>As a virtual event company based in India , we offer mobile Live Streaming Services to clients’ convenience. First of all, setting up of live streaming services includes end to end execution. For instance setting up of cameras, making arrangement of lighting, and getting the audio inputs and outputs correct.  In short, our onsite technical crew will have all of it covered for you.</p>
                            <p>We have handled all kinds of live streaming service requirements despite the nature of the venue. Our crew have executed live stream virtual events in closed indoors or open grounds, hotels or hospitals, auditoriums, or clubhouses. Importantly, a successful virtual event with live streaming support would require meticulous provisioning of various audio and video elements with a trained team to operate them.</p>
                            <p>Live streaming services are also essential for hybrid events where attendance on-site is kept to the minimum due to safe distancing regulations. Audiences can log in from places of their convenience to watch the ongoing event live from their preferred screens. We offer the best technical support to all clients to ensure that their hybrid events will be successfully broadcasted or streamed to the desired platforms so that audiences would not miss a single moment of the event.</p>

                            <p>With the rise of virtual events, there is a shift in priorities when it comes to event planning. Technology now plays a significant role since the search for the perfect venue has been replaced to finding the most immersive virtual event digital platform. Virtual event design work differ from on-site event design, however the visual elements are no less important. It is essential that customizing and branding of virtual event platform, websites or microsites, are important. Therefore to deliver a top notch digital experience for virtual events, there must be strong design options to suit clients’ expectations.</p>
                            <h3 class="my-2">The benefits of a virtual event platform / microsite</h3>
                            <p>Events are one of the most powerful tools for increasing brand awareness, as they offer unlimited opportunities for creating touchpoints between attendees and the brand. As virtual event platforms or microsites serve as the ‘venue’ for your virtual event, it is essential to consider how your digital venue will look like. Firstly, there are options of 2D to 3D customizable graphics on how your digital event ‘venue’ will look like. Secondly, to allow your attendees feel truly immersed in their event experience, a generic-looking platform with your event’s logo in the corner is not sufficient. Above all, our designers will leverage your brand colours, fonts and imagery to create a unique look and feel for your virtual event that will wow attendees the moment they first log on to your virtual event platform. In summary, branding your landing page, backgrounds, menus of the virtual platform and the contents of your livestream, will create an impactful digital brand experience for your virtual event.</p>
